            <h2>Extensive Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Staks Rosch has an extensive portfolio of writings that advance atheist and humanist ideas. His articles combine humor with pointed critiques of religious doctrine and advocacy of skepticism, reaching thousands of readers across multiple platforms.</p>
            
            <h2>Dangerous Talk Blog</h2>
            <p>He first gained renown through his blog <strong>Dangerous Talk</strong>, which began as a college radio show and evolved into a daily blog by 2006. On DangerousTalk.net, Rosch published regular commentary on "the three most dangerous topics"—religion, politics, and sex—from a secular progressive standpoint.</p>
            
            <p>His blog posts often combined humor with pointed critiques of religious doctrine. For example, he dissected concepts like faith healing with satirical articles such as "The Bible Cured Cancer!" In 2013, Rosch brought Dangerous Talk into the <strong>Skeptic Ink Network</strong> (a collective of secular bloggers), where he continues to write analytical pieces on current events and atheist thought.</p>

            <h2>National Atheism Examiner</h2>
            <p>In addition to blogging, Rosch served as the <strong>National Atheism Examiner on Examiner.com</strong>, writing articles to inform and unite the atheist community. This platform allowed him to reach a broader audience with news and commentary relevant to secular Americans.</p>
            
            <h2>The Huffington Post</h2>
            <p>As a <strong>Huffington Post contributor</strong>, Rosch reached a wider audience with op-eds and informational pieces on secularism. His HuffPost articles included topics such as biblical criticism—e.g., explaining why "The Biblical Exodus Story Is Fiction"—as well as political commentary from an atheist viewpoint.</p>
            
            <p>Rosch's writing is known for being direct yet accessible; he often writes in a conversational tone to invite those unfamiliar with atheism into the discussion.</p>
            
            <h2>Publishers Weekly</h2>

            <blockquote class="quote">
                "Being a freelance writer for Publishers Weekly gives me the opportunity to interview atheist and humanist authors and help put their books into the marketplace of ideas."
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>He has profiled prominent voices such as scientists examining belief, ex-clergy turned atheist writers, and religious authors grappling with secularism. Examples include interviews about books like <em>The Phantom God</em> by John C. Wathey and <em>Hi, I'm an Atheist!</em> by David G. McAfee.</p>
            
            <p>Through these Q&A pieces, Rosch facilitates dialogue on faith and doubt in a respectful, journalistic manner. His Publishers Weekly interviews bridge worlds—introducing humanist ideas to religious readers and vice versa—which he views as an extension of his activism to normalize atheism in mainstream culture.</p>
            
            <h2>Writing Style & Impact</h2>
            <p>Across all these writing platforms, Rosch's content consistently promotes reason, skepticism, and humanist ethics. Whether blogging passionately on Dangerous Talk or writing for national publications, he uses the written word to challenge dogma and encourage evidence-based thinking.</p>

His articles have reached thousands of readers, offering both a rational critique of religion and a positive case for humanist values in society.</p>

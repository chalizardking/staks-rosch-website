Staks Rosch

Biography

Staks Rosch is a Philadelphia-based atheist activist, writer, and philosopher known for promoting secular humanism and reason ￼. Originally from New Jersey, Rosch attended West Chester University, where he earned a Master’s Degree in Philosophy ￼. During graduate school, he became deeply involved in campus and community freethought activities. Over the last decade, Rosch has emerged as a leading voice in the atheist and humanist community, blending intellectual rigor with grassroots activism. He advocates for humanist values and critical thinking in public life, and has fought for the rights of minorities, women, and the LGBTQ+ community as part of his broader commitment to social justice ￼. In media appearances, Rosch has represented atheist viewpoints – for example, he was a panelist on the TV program It’s Your Call with Lynn Doyle (discussing Intelligent Design in schools) and even appeared on Christian talk radio to debate the merits of atheism ￼.

Rosch’s journey to atheism informs much of his work. Raised in a religious Jewish environment, he eventually de-converted and embraced secular humanism in his youth (a personal story he has shared with the community). Today, Rosch identifies as a Secular Humanist, skeptic, and rationalist, emphasizing that he “believes in people” rather than gods ￼. This human-centered philosophy underpins his activism and writing. While strongly critical of religion, he rejects stereotypes of “militant atheism” and instead promotes education and dialogue to diminish religion’s influence ￼ ￼. By combining academic background in philosophy with a passion for civic engagement, Staks Rosch has made a unique mark as both a thinker and an organizer in America’s secular movement.

The Book

One of Rosch’s notable contributions is his book “Disproving God and 5 Adequate Reasons To Be an Atheist” (Independently Published, 2021). This concise 58-page work is intended as an accessible introduction to atheism, presenting a straightforward argument against the existence of God alongside five reasons to embrace nonbelief ￼ ￼. Rosch began writing this booklet years earlier, aiming to “finally put to rest the whole God question,” and released it in March 2021 ￼. In the book, Rosch leverages his 30+ years of experience as an atheist activist who has heard countless religious arguments (and counter-arguments) to formulate “an argument that is simple and irrefutable,” delivered with his characteristic humor ￼.

Disproving God… has been well-received in secular circles for its clarity and brevity. Secular activist Janice Rael praised the book as “accessible, approachable atheism” and “a fresh look at a timeless question: Does God exist?”, noting that Rosch “answers succinctly.” Futurist author Zoltan Istvan likewise endorsed it, calling it “a true benefit to humanity” that makes a “simple and convincing case against the supernatural,” freeing people to embrace reality and strive for a better future ￼. Priced pointedly at $6.66, the book is available in paperback and e-book formats, with a possible audiobook in the works ￼. Through this work, Rosch seeks not only to rebut theistic claims but to equip readers (both skeptics and believers) with clear reasons supporting atheism, all in a quick-read format. The success of Disproving God has motivated Rosch to plan future writing projects, continuing his mission to spread rational, secular thought in an engaging way ￼.

Activism

Activism is at the core of Staks Rosch’s career. He has been heavily involved in organizing the secular community, particularly in the Philadelphia area. Rosch served as the head of the Philadelphia Coalition of Reason (PhillyCoR), an umbrella organization uniting local atheist, humanist, skeptic, and freethought groups ￼. In this leadership role, he coordinated events and outreach to bring nonbelievers together and into the public square. PhillyCoR garnered national attention for campaigns like a prominent billboard on Interstate 95 reading “Don’t believe in God? You are not alone.” – an invitation for questioning believers and nonreligious people to connect with the secular community ￼. Under Rosch’s coordination, PhillyCoR and its member groups hosted educational meetings, social gatherings, and media campaigns to raise the visibility of non-theists and defend the separation of church and state.

Beyond PhillyCoR, Rosch was a board member of the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia, working alongside other activists to support church-state separation and scientific thinking in the region ￼. He has also personally engaged in political activism: Rosch notes that he once traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby U.S. Senators in favor of free speech protections ￼. A self-described progressive, he has been active in Democratic Party circles while maintaining an independent critical outlook ￼. Rosch’s activism encompasses civil rights advocacy (championing equality for women, LGBTQ individuals, and religious minorities) and public policy (speaking out on issues from education to freedom of expression).

Importantly, Rosch’s activism often bridges into media and culture. He hosted “Dangerous Talk” as an atheist radio show on WCHE 1520 AM in Pennsylvania, using the airwaves to discuss atheism, politics, and social issues with a broad audience ￼. (He humorously dubbed religion, politics, and sex as “the three most dangerous topics of polite conversation.”) The radio show later moved online to the Freethought Radio Podcast Network – airing alongside programs like The Infidel Guy and The Rational Response Squad – extending its reach to an internet audience ￼. Through these platforms, Rosch gave voice to atheist perspectives and built a community of “Dangerous Talkers.” His approach to activism is consistently non-violent and education-focused; as he writes, “what atheists like me advocate is not eliminating religion [by force], but rather eliminating the influence of religion through education.” ￼ By organizing coalitions, creating content, and directly engaging with both lawmakers and the public, Staks Rosch has been a tireless advocate for secularism and humanist values.

Writings

Staks Rosch has an extensive portfolio of writings that advance atheist and humanist ideas. He first gained renown through his blog Dangerous Talk, which began as a college radio show and evolved into a daily blog by 2006 ￼. On DangerousTalk.net, Rosch published regular commentary on “the three most dangerous topics” – religion, politics, and sex – from a secular progressive standpoint ￼. His blog posts often combined humor with pointed critiques of religious doctrine and advocacy of skepticism. (For example, he dissected concepts like faith healing with satirical articles such as “The Bible Cured Cancer!” ￼.) In 2013, Rosch brought Dangerous Talk into the Skeptic Ink Network (a collective of secular bloggers), where he continues to write analytical pieces on current events and atheist thought. The blog features series like “Atheism 101” (basic answers to questions about atheism) and “Question Quesday” (where he playfully addresses quirky theological questions) to engage readers in critical thinking.

In addition to blogging, Rosch has been a contributor to major media outlets. He served as the National Atheism Examiner on Examiner.com, writing articles to inform and unite the atheist community ￼. As a Huffington Post contributor, Rosch reached a wider audience with op-eds and informational pieces on secularism. His HuffPost articles included topics such as biblical criticism – e.g. explaining why “The Biblical Exodus Story Is Fiction” ￼ – as well as political commentary from an atheist viewpoint. Rosch’s writing is known for being direct yet accessible; he often writes in a conversational tone to invite those unfamiliar with atheism into the discussion.

Notably, Staks Rosch is also a freelance writer for Publishers Weekly, focusing on religion and spirituality books ￼. In this role, he conducts interviews with authors across the belief spectrum. “Being a freelance writer for Publishers Weekly gives me the opportunity to interview atheist and humanist authors and help put their books into the marketplace of ideas,” Rosch explains ￼. He has profiled prominent voices such as scientists examining belief, ex-clergy turned atheist writers, and religious authors grappling with secularism ￼ ￼. Through these Q&A pieces, Rosch facilitates dialogue on faith and doubt in a respectful, journalistic manner. His Publishers Weekly interviews bridge worlds – introducing humanist ideas to religious readers and vice versa – which he views as an extension of his activism to normalize atheism in mainstream culture ￼.

Across all these writing platforms, Rosch’s content consistently promotes reason, skepticism, and humanist ethics. Whether blogging passionately on Dangerous Talk or writing for national publications, he uses the written word to challenge dogma and encourage evidence-based thinking. His versatility as a writer – spanning personal blogs, news outlets, and even an atheist advice column (he once ran an “Ask an Atheist” series) – has made Staks Rosch a familiar name in secular circles. His articles have reached thousands of readers, offering both a rational critique of religion and a positive case for humanist values in society.

Philosophy

At heart, Staks Rosch approaches philosophy not just as an academic subject, but as a guide for living ethically without religion. Secular philosophy underpins all of his work. Having formally studied philosophy (earning an M.A. in the field) ￼, Rosch frequently draws on philosophical principles like empiricism, logic, and ethics derived from human welfare rather than divine command. He aligns himself with Enlightenment values – reason, human dignity, freedom of thought – and applies these to contemporary issues. Rosch often emphasizes that one can live a meaningful, moral life without belief in any gods. In his view, meaning comes from human connections and improving this world, not from supernatural beliefs ￼.

Rosch’s philosophical outlook is evident in how he debates and writes. He often invokes the importance of critical thinking and skepticism. For example, he highlights that many religious claims fail under rational scrutiny, and he encourages asking tough questions about faith. Rosch has argued that no idea – not even deeply held religious doctrine – should be immune from “reasonable” critique, famously quoting, “There is no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too reasonable.” ￼. He stands against what he calls “ridiculous beliefs” unsupported by evidence, whether it’s creationism or purported miracles ￼. At the same time, his philosophy rejects hostility; Rosch advocates engaging believers through education and dialogue rather than coercion ￼. He has explicitly refuted the notion that atheists want to forcibly eradicate religion, clarifying that his goal is to reduce religion’s influence by spreading knowledge and promoting secular alternatives ￼.

As a self-identified rationalist and Humanist, Rosch’s ethics are grounded in compassion and human rights. He often cites Humanist principles when supporting equality and free inquiry. Politically, his philosophy aligns with progressive liberalism – valuing democratic ideals, social justice, and evidence-based policy – but always through a secular lens (he often critiques religious intrusion into politics). In public speeches and writings, Rosch sometimes delves into classic philosophical questions (e.g. the problem of evil, morality without God) and offers layperson-friendly explanations of atheist philosophy. By breaking down complex concepts, he works to dispel myths about atheism (such as the trope that without God, life has no meaning or morality). In sum, Staks Rosch’s philosophy can be described as pragmatic humanism: a blend of skepticism, compassion, and confidence in human reason as the path to progress.

Music

In addition to writing and activism, Staks Rosch has explored music as a medium for secular message. In 2025, he launched an unconventional project: an atheist-themed AI music band called Reason+1 (pronounced “Reason Plus One). This experimental musical endeavor uses artificial intelligence to generate rock songs that convey humanist and atheist themes. The debut album, titled “That Ungodly Sound,” was released on Memorial Day 2025 ￼. Rosch introduced Reason+1 as an “atheist/humanist themed musical experience,” warning tongue-in-cheek that the songs “contain deep philosophical arguments” against religion ￼. The album’s tracks have provocative titles that reflect its secular spirit – for instance, “Don’t Need Jesus To Save My Soul,” “God is Imaginary,” “Blasphemy,” and “Heart Over Heaven,” among others ￼. Each song blends rock melodies with lyrics that challenge religious doctrine and celebrate critical thought.

Rosch’s foray into music is both creative and strategic: it aims to reach new audiences through art and entertainment. By using AI-generated compositions, Reason+1 pushes boundaries in both technology and message – it’s a novel way to spread atheist ideas. The project has been promoted via social media to grow a fanbase among freethinkers (Rosch frequently invites his followers to check out the songs and share them). While That Ungodly Sound is often humorous and satirical, it also resonates with those who have left religion and can relate to its irreverent anthems. The combination of AI and atheist content is relatively unique, positioning Reason+1 as perhaps the first “virtual atheist band.”

Music has long played a role in social movements, and Rosch seems keen to add an atheist anthem to the mix. With Reason+1, he channels his activism through a creative outlet – using catchy tunes to reinforce secular values and critique dogma in a memorable way. The project is still in its early stages, but it represents Rosch’s willingness to experiment with new forms of outreach. By integrating music, humor, and technology, Staks Rosch continues to find innovative avenues to promote reason, science, and humanist ideals – proving that even rock music can carry the gospel of atheism (so to speak) to the masses.
